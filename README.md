### CargoTracker2FSharp 
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7klhk6j33jev4i1p?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/klimisa/cargotracker2fsharp)

[Carco Tracker](https://github.com/gtourkas/CargoTracker2) initially made by [@tourkas](https://twitter.com/georgetourkas) for demonstrating Domain Driven Design principles to the [DDDGreece](https://meetup.com/dddgreece) community.

The target is to apply gradually all features of F# until to the final point where Domain Driven Design principles are applied. 
Some metrics will take place and listed here in order to compare the two approaches as we go along. 

In branch [phase-0](https://github.com/klimisa/CargoTracker2FSharp/tree/phase-0) there is a direct port - line by line - of the [Shipping Domain](https://github.com/gtourkas/CargoTracker2/tree/master/Domain) to F#. 
The original test suite runs to ensure the correctness of the port.
